# git-training-v1
It is a GitHub training repository created by me
The purpose of creating this repository is to maintain a record of successive knowledge gained during the course of learing how to use git and github.
This repository is created for practice the aspects learned during course and also to answer some of the basic doubs and how to do.... too.
NOTE:-This is my personal venture in learning git and github.
